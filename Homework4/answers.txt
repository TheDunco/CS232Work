1. The PCB class is defined at the end of calos.py
3. It defines the possible states, the pid, the registers, the quantum (how long process runs), the name, and the next PID.
4. In main.py, line 177 defines a new PCB and creates it in line 180.
5. The pre-defined process states are NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, and DONE.
6. The code waits until it has the MutEx lock in order to run (it is a critical section). 
    The with statement will handle the lock (taking it, giving it when done). 
    Basically, it ensures that it it cleans up after itself like a "using" statement in C# (which I have used a lot).
7. Basically, it's a critical section (interrupt) so the CPU takes over the MutEx lock to handle it and releases the lock when it's done.
